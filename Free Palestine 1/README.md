# 🍉 Free Palestine Support Web Components

We condemn all the massacres committed by the murderer ~~Israel~~ against the free Palestinian people. Oppression is oppression no matter who it is done to.

In this repo you will find support codes that you can add to your website.
You can customize the codes according to your own website.
